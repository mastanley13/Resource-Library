Below is the final public‑facing copy for every page of your new Strategix AI site—no references to TypeScript, React, 3‑D libraries, or other build‑time frameworks appear anywhere in the text users will see.
At the very end you’ll find a short, clearly separated note for the coding AI that specifies the build stack (TypeScript + React with optional 3 JS flourishes).

WHY STRATEGIX AI

Your Challenge	Our Edge
AI “audits” that deliver a slide deck and no follow‑through.	We hand you a costed 90‑day Action Plan plus a prototype backlog you can start tomorrow.
Pet‑care tools solve bookings but ignore day‑to‑day operations.	Our Dog‑Care Ops Suite unifies staff tasks, client portal, voice bots, and CRM automation in one build.
Call‑analytics platforms analyse calls only after they’re over.	Sales Trainer coaches reps during the call and auto‑grades instantly.
Generic voice bots stop at answering the phone.	We link voice, CRM, and marketing workflows so every interaction fuels the next sale.

(Optional rotating quote carousel with three client testimonials.)
